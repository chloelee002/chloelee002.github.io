								<h1> Why Birds Don't Get Shocked When They Perch On Power Lines?</h1>
								<p>There is only electrons flow when there is difference in voltage.  When a bird perch on power line, there is no voltage difference between the bird and the power line.  Moreover, as the power cable is a better conductor than the bird, therefore, the electrons will flow through the power line rather than the bird and thus, the bird will not get electric shock.</p>

								<h2>What Happens to Your Body If You Get Struck by Lightning Right Now</h2>
								<p>Your body will be under direct influence of the strike for approximately 3 milliseconds. 1/3 of you will die from cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, inhibition of your brainstem’s respiratory centers or just from a catastrophic, multisystem failure.The majority of you will: 
								Have one or both of your eardrums burst. Experience a loss of consciousness. 
								Have 3rd degree burns from metal you were in contact with at the time of the strike such as jewelry as well as very small, but deep burns at the entry and exit wound sites. (The temperature of a lightning strike is about 28,000 degrees Celsius and 50,000 Farenheit). These burns will often take the shape of Lichtenburg Figures under the skin: Link with pics.) 
								Experience complete (but temporary) paralysis.
								Experience bursting capalaries under your skin from shockwave or current. 
								In addition: 
								If you happen to be listening to AM radio you’ll be unnable to get reception for the duration of the strike as lightning severely interferes with amplitude modulation.
								The heat of lightning that strikes sandy areas of the ground underneath you may fuse the soil or sand into glass channels called fulgurites.
								Your clothing may become shredded, torn off or singed.
								Early on, survivors will complain of intense headaches, ringing in the ears, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and other post-concussion types of symptoms.
								Long-term effects that 70% of you have to look forward to:
								Numbness/Weakness in limbs.
								Sleep and memory disorders and problems concentrating.
								Storm Phobia combined with Post Traumatic Stress disorder.
								Development of seizure-like activity several weeks or even months after the injury.
								Possible personality changes because of frontal lobe damage and increased irritability and anger.</p>

								<h2>Can carbon jump</h2>

								<h2>What is a conductor</h2>
								<p>An electrical conductor is a substance in which electrical charge carriers, usually electrons, move easily from atom to atom with the application of voltage. Conductivity, in general, is the capacity to transmit something, such as electricity or heat. Some liquids are good electrical conductors. Mercury is an excellent example. A saturated salt-water solution acts as a fair conductor. Gases are normally poor conductors because the atoms are too far apart to allow a free exchange of electrons. However, if a sample of gas contains a significant number of ions, it can act as a fair conductor.</p>

								<h2>What causes lightning</h2>
								<p> When air rises and falls within a thunderstorm, positive and negative charges form and build up in the cloud. The bottom of the thundercloud has a negative charge, and the top has a positive charge. A flash of lightning happens when the charge becomes too large for the air to stop it from jumping from the cloud to the ground, which bears a positive charge. Lightning could also form inside the cloud, moving between the positively and negatively charged areas. The average flash of lightning could turn on a 100-watt light bulb for more than three months. The air near a lightning strike becomes hotter than the surface of the Sun.</p>

								<h2>What unit is electric power mewasured in and why</h2>
								<p>Electric power is mewasured in Watts. Electric power is mewasured in Watts because watts (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second. The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy is dissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated. Fun fact: the Japanese name of thunderbolt means 10,000 Watts.</p>
