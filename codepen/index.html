<h1> Why Birds Don't Get Shocked When They Perch On Power Lines?</h1>
<h2>When the bird perches on a live wire, its body becomes charged, it becomes the same voltage as the wire. However no current flows into her body, as a body is a poor conductor compared to copper wire, so there's no reason for electrons to take a detour through the bird. More importantly, electrons current flow from high voltage to low voltage. Therefore, the current, in effect, ignores the bird. 

But if the bird accidentally touches an something else (a electrical ground) while in contact with the high-voltage wire, it completes an electrical circuit. A ground has approximately zero voltage. The ground, and any electical conductors touching it, is the ground.</h2>

<h1>What causes lightning?</h1>
<h2> When air rises and falls within a thunderstorm, positive and negative charges form and build up in the cloud. The bottom of the thundercloud has a negative charge, and the top has a positive charge. A flash of lightning happens when the charge becomes too large for the air to stop it from jumping from the cloud to the ground, which bears a positive charge. Lightning could also form inside the cloud, moving between the positively and negatively charged areas. The average flash of lightning could turn on a 100-watt light bulb for more than three months. The air near a lightning strike becomes hotter than the surface of the Sun.</h2>
